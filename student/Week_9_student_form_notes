***Student sign in page:
Most of the HTML is written for you

Uses Bootstrap, but Bootstrap is not necessary for Vue
Only to make the page look a little nicer, for example, tables and alerts

Code in the /student directory: student_sign_in.html and styles.css
You'll create the Vue app
Look for the TODO comments in the HTML template

***Welcome message***
**when clicking the "present" box on the page, what happens behind the scenes?:

Would like to see a  'Welcome' message for the most recent student to sign in
When a student leaves, show a 'Goodbye' message

Couple of approaches:
Can watch the values of properties and automatically run a function when they are changed –
we'll see that in some other examples – but it doesn't work very well with objects in arrays.
Hard to tell what changed

Can add a v-on:change event handler that calls a function when the checkbox is changed
(checked or unchecked)   <- this is easier for this application
- also need to think about what data we may need to store or work with.
- it would be helpful to think about capturing the data from the most recent arrival or departure student info.
    **add a new property to capture that data. (add mostRecentStudent in the vue app (let app = Vue.createApp(),
    after the errors (don't forget the comma)

***Modify checkbox***

Add v-on:change to the checkbox input
The event handler functions can be called with arguments
arrivedOrLeft function can take an argument – in this case, the student object the row is for
So, we can tell who arrived, or left

in order to compare because lower case a has a larger number than
capital Z. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters
